# Awesome Formal Software Analysis and Modeling

üìê A list of projects that helps to formally analyse, model and asses complex software systems.

## Frameworks

### Desing Level

* [Alloy - an open source language and analyzer for software modeling. Used in a wide range of applications from finding holes in security mechanisms to designing telephone switching networks](https://alloytools.org/)
* [P Lang - Formal Modeling and Analysis of Distributed Systems](https://p-org.github.io/P/)
* [TLA+ - a high-level language for modeling programs and systems--especially concurrent and distributed ones](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html?from=https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html&type=path)
* [Spin - an open-source multi-threaded software verification tool](https://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html)
* [Event-B - a formal method for system-level modelling and analysis. Key features of Event-B are the use of set theory as a modelling notation, the use of refinement to represent systems at different abstraction levels and the use of mathematical proof to verify consistency between refinement levels.](http://www.event-b.org/index.html)
* [mCRL2 - a formal specification language with an associated toolset for modelling, validation and verification of concurrent systems and protocols](https://www.mcrl2.org/web/user_manual/index.html)

### Code-Level

* [Dafny - a verification-aware programming language that has native support for recording specifications and is equipped with a static program verifier.](https://dafny.org/)
